              Kwon and his good friend <i>Dong Young-Bae</i>, originally planned to debut as a hip-hop duo. Kwon chose <strong>G-Dragon</strong> to be his stage name, since <i>Ji</i> was pronounced like "G" and <i<>Yong</i> was korean for "Dragon". Instead, YG Entertainment opted for a boy-band.

              In 2017, G-Dragon released another solo record. The album, titled by his own name, expressed many of his thoughts and frustrations of the real world. Most notably, he announced that he wanted to seperate himself from his stage persona. G-Dragon didn't want people to remember him as G-Dragon, but rather as Kwon Ji-Yong.

              While he has halted in his musical endeavors, G-Dragon still continues to play a big role in korean culture.
